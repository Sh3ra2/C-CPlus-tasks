# C-programs-and-projects
A collection of my personal tasks and projects that I have worked on.

Hi there!
This is a collection of all the tasks that I have completed throughout my degree whcih have helped me to learn C++ and C, 
These programs are from beginner to advanced level programs based on the kind of tasks we had to build, 
which can be as simple as to create an array and as advanced as to create a student management system using file handling and with heap memory.
